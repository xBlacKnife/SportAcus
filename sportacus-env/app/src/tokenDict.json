            "Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year.",
            "And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.",
            "For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form.",
            "In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions.",
            "Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March."
